PyTorch Code for the paper at ICLR2020:
**Title**: *DivideMix: Learning with Noisy Labels as Semi-supervised Learning*



**Experiments**
cifar-10 or cifar-100 dataset need to be download first, and rename the document as 'cifar-10' or 'cifar-100'.

Experiment in dataloader_cifar.ipynb file in jupyter Notebook.

or

Run 
`python Train_cifar.py --data_path --dataset` 



We also have made some changes for cifar-10 and cifar-100:

`python Train_cifar_refinement_for_low_noise.py ` 

`python Train_cifar_refinement_with_CNN.py `
